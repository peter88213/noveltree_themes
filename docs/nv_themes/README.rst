**User guide**

This page refers to the latest `nv_themes
<https://github.com/peter88213/nv_themes/>`__ release.

The plugin adds a **Change theme** entry to the *novelibre* **View** menu.


.. note::
   Actually, this plugin is more intended for Linux, where the default theme looks pretty stale, and there are plenty of desktops, each with a different look.

   On Windows, *novelibre* uses a lot of native widgets by default, you can hardly do better with custom themes.


Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_themes_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_themes_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_themes_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file. 

   
Start the dialog
----------------

Start the theme changer from the main menu: **View > Change theme**.
